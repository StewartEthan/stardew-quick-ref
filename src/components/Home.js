      <p>Welcome to the Stardew Valley Quick Reference! This is intended to be an easy-to-navigate quick lookup tool for Stardew Valley. While I love the official wiki and highly encourage everyone to use it, I find it sometimes annoying to navigate on a mobile device. I usually use my phone to look things up in the wiki while I play, so I notice it frequently. If I was most recently on a villager's page, and then come back to look up when you can catch a largemouth bass, I have to either know the URL or use the search function. I've been itching to do a side project for a little while, so I decided to make an alternative reference, with pages more lightweight and focused on what I usually need to look up while playing, and a focus on easier navigation from any random page to any other random page (especially on mobile).</p>
