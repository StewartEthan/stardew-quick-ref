I've been playing a lot of Stardew Valley lately, which means I've been using [the official wiki](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley_Wiki) as a reference quite a bit. This is an amazing resource, but with how much I jump around in it, I often find it mildly inconvenient to navigate, especially on mobile. For example, if I'm on the page for a person, then want to go look up what time of day to catch a specific fish, I have to use the search or know the URL. A first world problem for sure, but we're moving to a React based stack at work, and this seemed like a fun side project that a) lets me get more familiar with React, and b) lets me create a watered-down Stardew Valley reference/guide with navigation designed for sporadic clicking around on a mobile device. Win-win for me, plus I haven't done a coding side project in a long time and have been feeling an itch to do so for a while.

To be clear, **THIS IS NOT INTENDED AS A WIKI REPLACEMENT.** I don't intend to go as in-depth as the wiki does on many things, and will most likely not contain a page for every single wiki page.

_Link to live deployment will be here when I have one_
